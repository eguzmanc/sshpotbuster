## Overview

**Potbuster** is a tool designed to detect SSH honeypots. It runs a series of checks to identify potential honeypot servers. These checks include banner analysis, connection delay, invalid command responses, and more. This tool is beneficial for security testing of SSH servers to uncover possible traps or suspicious behavior.

## Features

- **Banner Analysis**: Checks the SSH banner for known honeypot signatures.
- **Connection Delay**: Measures the time it takes to establish a connection.
- **Invalid Command Responses**: Sends commands and analyzes the responses for anomalies.
- **Multiple Protocol Support**: Works with various SSH configurations.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for quick checks.

## Installation

To get started with SSHPotbuster, you need to download the latest release. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/eguzmanc/sshpotbuster/releases) to find the appropriate file for your system. Download and execute the file as instructed in the release notes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eguzmanc/sshpotbuster.git
   cd sshpotbuster
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:

   Use pip to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Tool**:

   After installation, you can run SSHPotbuster directly from the command line.

## Usage

Using SSHPotbuster is straightforward. You can run the tool with a simple command. 

### Basic Command

To check a specific SSH server, use the following command:

```bash
python sshpotbuster.py <target_ip>
```

Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the SSH server you want to test.

### Example

```bash
python sshpotbuster.py 192.168.1.1
```

This command will initiate the checks on the specified IP address.

## Checks Performed

SSHPotbuster performs several key checks to determine if an SSH server is a honeypot:

1. **Banner Analysis**: 
   - Retrieves the SSH banner and checks it against a database of known honeypot banners.
  
2. **Connection Delay**: 
   - Measures the time taken to establish a connection. Honeypots often introduce delays.
  
3. **Invalid Command Responses**: 
   - Sends various commands and checks for unusual responses that may indicate a honeypot.
  
4. **Protocol Version Check**: 
   - Verifies the SSH protocol version in use. Some honeypots may use outdated versions.
  
5. **Session Behavior**: 
   - Observes how the server responds to session initiation requests.
